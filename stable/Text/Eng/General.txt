#TEXTINTRO From ancient times the true history of the land of elves has been covered by a carpet of tranquility. Until the time when this once serene land was deluged from within by the malicious hordes of undead warriors.\Whilst still a young elf of twenty-eight summers, Elhant dared to challenge the forces of evil and attempt to rescue the world from the clutches of eternal darkness. Although being uncertain about the actual powers of the undead and naive to the dangers ahead, Elhant was confident. He had twice won the ritual duel with death, and his powers were now stronger then ever. His mastery of the fiery Khaelgor and composite Longbow was unmatched. Clad in the green robe of his Strain, he was the only one here, at the outskirts of the elven capital, to stand steadfast against the remnants of the undead legion.\The buds of their evil empire are swelling across this region. Elhant must sever them swiftly.
